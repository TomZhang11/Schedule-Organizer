    <h2>File Descriptions</h2>
    <h3>classes.txt</h3>
    <p>This is the text file containing classes that will be put onto the Excel sheet. There must be 3 columns "Course", "Term", and "Schedule" (in this order). Additional columns are ignored. Check classes.txt in the "sample files" folder for examples.</p>

    <h3>departments.txt</h3>
    <p>This is the text file that assigns each class to a department. You may modify this file to add or remove departments, change department names, or add new classes to a department. The format of this file is a department name, followed by a colon, then space-separated uppercase class codes. Check departments.txt in the "sample files" folder for examples.</p>

    <h3>heights.txt</h3>
    <p>This is the text file specifying how many rows each period and lunch will take up. You may modify this file if the heights are too tall or too short. Check heights.txt in the "sample files" folder for examples.</p>

    <h3>class values.xlsx</h3>
    <p>This file specifies the values added to the "Totals" section of the Excel file for each class. You can add decimal values, values to different grades, or remove existing values. The format includes a "Classes" column for the class code, and a "Semester" column for specifying the semesters applicable (e.g., S1, S2, FY). Check class values.xlsx in the "sample files" folder for examples.</p>
    
    <h3>schedule.xlsx</h3>
    <p>This is the Excel sheet containing the organized class schedule. Classes are color-coded: purple for group classes, pink for full year day 1, orange for full year day 2, and red for full year day 1-2. Check schedule.xlsx in the "sample files" folder for examples.</p>
