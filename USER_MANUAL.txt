Class Organizer
Programmed by Tom Zhang

Purpose:
This program organizes a text file into an Excel sheet for better visualization of the class schedule.

Requirements:
- The program can only be run on a Windows system.
- In the folder where the executable file is, there must be a folder named "Input" (cannot be renamed), and it should contain 4 files:
        1. classes.txt (mandatory) (can be renamed as long as there is "classes" in the name)
        2. departments.txt (mandatory) (cannot be renamed)
        3. heights.txt (mandatory) (cannot be renamed)
        4. class values.xlsx (optional) (cannot be renamed)
  note: there cannot be multiple classes files

Instructions:
1. Make sure all requirements are met.
2. If there are other schedule Excel files open on the computer, close them.
3. Double click on "organize.exe".
  note: when the program is used for the first time, a window will show up saying the software is blocked. Click on "More Details", then on "Run Anyway"
4. "Command Prompt" will show up containing output from the program, read it to determine if the program has run successfully, then press "Enter".
5. If the program has run successfully, go to the Output folder to look for the schedule Excel sheet.

Here are some notes about the files in the folder:

- You may modify this file if you want to:
        - add departments
        - remove departments
        - change department names
        - add new classes to a department
        - add the department for a class

- The format of this file is department name (name it as you prefer), colon, followed by space seperated uppercase class codes that show up as the first 3 letters in the classes file.
- Check departments.txt in "sample files" folder for examples.

********* heights.txt *********
- This is the text file specifying how many rows each period and lunch will take up.
- You may modify this file if the heights are too tall or too short.

********* class values.xlsx *********
- This is the file specifying the values added to the "Totals" section of the Excel file for each class.
- You may modify this file if you want to add decimal values, add values to different grades, or remove existing values.
- To add a class, enter the class code that shows up in the classes file to the Classes column, dropping any parts with "grp" and 3-digit codes.
